# EM-star-multiomic

For studying cancer biology, multiomic data integration has become an invaluable tool. With the amount of -omics data, its availability and the pace of its acquisition all increasing rapidly, multiomic data integration is even more pivotal. This work employs a novel adaptation of the expectation maximisation routine for joint latent variable modeling of multiomic patient profiles. Along with traditional methods of biological feature selection, the data centric approach toward latent distribution optimization can adequately cluster patients from well-studied cancer types and does so with decreases to computational expense. Crucially, this work slightly modifies the optimization subroutines in the relatively standard joint latent variable -omics workflow for increased survival analysis and run time performance. This work also provides a framework that identifies distinctions between cancer subtypes and proposes potential biomarkers for breast cancer.
